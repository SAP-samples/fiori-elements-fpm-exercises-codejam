# Chapter 02 - Creating the SAP Fiori elements application

By the end of this chapter we will have created an SAP Fiori elements application that consumes our bookshop backend service.

## 1. Launch the SAP Fiori Tools Application Generator

The [SAP Fiori Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.sap-ux-fiori-tools-extension-pack) is an extension pack for Visual Studio Code that bundles extensions that help with SAP Fiori development (if you opted to use the SAP Business Application Studio then this is already included in the `Full Stack Cloud Application` dev space type you selected). We will use it extensively during this SAP CodeJam - starting with the creation of an SAP Fiori elements application. If you have not installed the SAP Fiori Tools yet, go back and work through [chapter 0](/chapters/00-prep-dev-environment/).

➡️ Open the command palette (Command/Ctrl + Shift + P), search for "Application Generator", and launch the SAP Fiori Tools Application Generator:

## 2. Create an SAP Fiori elements application

➡️ Create an application using the following settings and properties for the template wizard:

|||
| - | - |
| Template Type | SAP Fiori |
| Which template do you want to use? | List Report Page |
| Data source | Use a Local CAP Project |
| Choose your CAP project | bookshop |
| OData service | CatalogService (Node.js) |
| Main entity | Books |
| Navigation entity | None |
| Automatically add table columns to the list page and a section to the object page if none already exists? | Yes |
| Table Type | Responsive |
| Module name | bookshop-ui |
| Application title | Bookshop |
| Application namespace | *leave empty* |
| Description | A simple bookshop application. |
| Minimum SAPUI5 version | *choose latest patch of version **1.120*** |
| Add deployment configuration to MTA project | No |
| Add FLP configuration | No |
| Configure advanced options | No

We created a new SAP Fiori elements application that consumes the bookshop backend service from our local SAP CAP application. We selected `Books` as the main entity. Let's now inspect this new application.

## 3. Inspect the newly created application

➡️ Open the `app/bookshop-ui/` directory and inspect its contents.

If you are familiar with UI5, you will recognize this project structure immediately (if you are not, check out this repository: [ui5-exercises-codejam](https://github.com/SAP-Samples/ui5-exercises-codejam)):
- The `webapp/` directory contains the actual web application - most importantly the `Component.js`, `index.html`, and `manifest.json`.
- The `app/bookshop-ui/` directory also contains its own `package.json`, which means it is a Node.js based application. It's a common practice to have nested Node.js applications during design time.
- The `app/bookshop-ui/` directory also contains a `ui5.yaml`, which allows us to configure the [UI5 Tooling](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/cli).

This project structure begs the question: What is the difference between a (freestyle) UI5 application and an SAP Fiori elements application?

> An SAP Fiori elements application is a certain kind of UI5 application that uses a predefined [floorplan](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/797c3239b2a9491fa137e4998fd76aa7.html) (think "application layout") - following a metadata-driven approach. Technically speaking, an SAP Fiori elements application uses the `sap/fe/core/AppComponent` from the SAPUI5 library. This means every SAP Fiori elements application is a UI5 application, but not vice versa. The opposite of an SAP Fiori elements application is a freestyle UI5 application, which implements its own custom layout (views) and application logic (controllers). The situation is not exactly black and white, however, as the [SAP Fiori elements flexible programming model](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/overview/introduction) provides metadata-driven building blocks that can be used alongside freestyle UI5 coding. This set of exercises is dedicated to this powerful feature that combines the best of both worlds.

## 4. Install dependencies

➡️ Navigate into the directory of the newly created application and run the following command to install its dependencies:

```bash
cd app/bookshop-ui
npm install
```

## 5. Start the SAP CAP server

➡️ (Re)start the SAP CAP server by running the following command from the `bookshop/` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

We (re)started the SAP CAP server - just like in the previous chapter. There is one small difference to note though: The logs now include the following:f
message, which indicates the SAP CAP server now also serves our frontend application with the help of the [`cds-plugin-ui5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cds-plugin-ui5):

```text
[cds-plugin-ui5] [info] Mounting /bookshopui to UI5 app ...
```

## 6. Test the SAP Fiori elements application

➡️ (Re)visit the URL of the SAP CAP server, refresh the page, and click on the link for the `/bookshopui/index.html` application:

![http://localhost:4004](server.png)
![SAP Fiori elements application](app.png)

We created a fully functional SAP Fiori elements application. Feel free to play around with the application - click "Go", then click one of the books in the table to navigate to its object page.

## 7. Further questions to discuss

➡️ If you happen to finish this chapter early, think about the following questions (that we will discuss later):

- Why was there no option in the template wizard to use OpenUI5 instead of SAPUI5?
- How does the SAP CAP server know it should serve the newly created SAP Fiori elements application?
- What is the benefit of using the [`cds-plugin-ui5`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cds-plugin-ui5)?
